â€žProgramming is a craft. It is dependent on individual skill,
attention to detail, and knowledge of how to use available tools
in the best way. Craftsmen must know their materials,
understand the principles of their craft and learn by experience.
Thus, programmers must understand both host and target
computer systems, must know some theory of programming,
and must practise programming.â€œ
- Ian Sommerville (1989)
